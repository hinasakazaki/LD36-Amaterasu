Game Objectective: Click on Sun at "beats" of the music after loading in a song of your choice (.ogg files)

Many .ogg files are available on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_non-free_audio_samples

Beats are detected by Allan Pichardo's Unity Beat Detection library. However, beats are not very accurate, so beware!
